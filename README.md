# hello-world
A short description

Just kidding. 

The GitHub tutorial told me to make a new repository with titled hello-world
with a README file attached to it. 
Is this helping me learn Git?

About Me:
I am a Computer Systems Technician, currently working on expanding my repertoire into
development and design. I would like to learn many new topics and trades. Professionally, 
this has a beneficial side effect, but in all honesty, I couldn't be more bored with what
I'm doing. Creating seems to be the only way to inject new and exciting habits into my daily
hum-drum routines, and it's something I can always learn, expand on, and get better at. 
I hope to learn a lot, and never stop creating.
